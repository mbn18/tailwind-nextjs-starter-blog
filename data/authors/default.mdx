Welcome to my digital brain dump! I'm Michael Ben-Nes (aka Miki), and I've been writing software and building systems for 30 years. Yes, I started back when dial-up was cutting-edge technology—in fact, I even owned an ISP!

## What I Do Best

My superpower is understanding what businesses actually need (not just what they think they want), finding elegant solutions that serve those goals, and executing cost-effective workflows that deliver professional, maintainable, and scalable results.
So to summerize: **Make it work!**

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is where I record my thoughts, share practical tips, dive into real-world use cases, and hopefully pass along some useful memories.

## Let's Build Something Together!

I'm always on the hunt for my next adventure! Don't be shy—share your ideas and let's see if we can turn them into reality. Whether it's a complex system architecture challenge or an innovative startup concept, I'm all ears.

## My Technical Arsenal

### Core Principles
* **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** - Because understanding the problem is half the solution
* **Event-Driven Architecture** - For systems that actually scale
* **SOLID Principles** - The foundation of maintainable code
* **Patterns & Standards** - Proven practices lead to better software
* **KISS** - My personal favorite and most important rule

### Languages I Speak (Fluently)
* **Go** - For performance and simplicity
* **Python** - For rapid development and data magic
* **JavaScript** - Because the web runs on it
* **Dart** - Flutter and beyond
* **PHP** - Still relevant for many projects
* Known, but not used for some time: c#, Java, Perl, Bash, LOGO????

### Event Streaming & Messaging
* Kafka, NATS, Amazon SQS, ZeroMQ, and more

### Databases (All Flavors)
* **Relational**: PostgreSQL and family
* **Search & Analytics**: Elasticsearch
* **Graph**: Neo4J/Dgraph for complex relationships
* **Document/Key-Value**: CouchBase and friends
* **Embedded**: Isar/SQLite for applications
* **Vector**: PGVector for AI/ML applications
* Plus other hybrids depending on the use case

### Orchestration & DevOps
* Docker for containerization
* Kubernetes for orchestration
* GitHub Actions for CI/CD
* And the usual suspects

### Protocols & APIs
* REST (the reliable workhorse)
* gRPC (for performance-critical services)
* SOAP (when legacy systems demand it)
